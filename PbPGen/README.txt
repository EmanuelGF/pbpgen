PbPGen (Profile based Password Generator)

The purpose of this software is to test password strenght and network security. Entering on a system without permission is a crime.
I do not accept any responsabilities for the wrong usage of this software.

This software generates password wordlist based upon data collected from target and some common password patterns.
It then mixes the data entered to create the wordlist.

Like I said this data can be any number of info gathered from the target like birthdate, family name, relative names,
 favorite things, company name etc...
