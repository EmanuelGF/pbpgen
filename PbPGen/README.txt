PbPGen (Profile based Password Generator)

The purpose of this software is to test network security. Entering on a system without permission is a crime.
I do not accept any responsabilities for the wrong usage of this software.

This software generates password wordlist based upon data collected from target and some common password patterns.
It then mixes everything to create the wordlist.

Like I said this data can be any number of info gathered from the target like birthdate, family name, relative names,
 favorite things, company name etc...
To generate optimum wordlist some degree of investigation has to be done before hand.

Here are some guidelines:
    Gather basic info about target: name, age, relative names, pet name, location, related sport, favorite shows... 
    (You can easely gather this info on social networks)
    Tweek this depending on the case cenario.

    Try to find how long is the password.
